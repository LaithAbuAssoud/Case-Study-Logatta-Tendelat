# Case Study: Tendelat E-commerce Platform - Django Backend Development

## Project Overview

Tendelat is a modern e-commerce platform that facilitates interactions between merchants, customers, and delivery companies. Merchants can establish their own stores and offer limited-time discounts and promotions. The platform automatically manages stock and closes promotions when an item reaches its purchase limit.

## My Role

**Position:** Django Backend Developer

## Teamwork and Responsibilities

Collaborated with a development team to build the backend functionalities for several key features:

- **User Authentication (Login & Registration):** Implemented secure user authentication for both login and registration functionalities. This involved user data management, secure password hashing, and session management.
  
- **Access Control & Permissions:** Ensured secure access control throughout the platform by defining user roles, permissions, and implementing authorization checks for various actions.
  
- **Delivery Company Integration:** Played a key role in integrating Tendelat with third-party delivery companies, enabling seamless logistics management.
  
- **User Subscription (Optional):** Designed and implemented the backend logic for a user subscription system (if applicable). This included managing different subscription tiers, handling recurring payments, and providing access to exclusive content or features based on subscription level.
  
- **Payment Processing System:** Implemented a secure payment processing system by integrating with electronic payment gateways, enabling smooth and secure customer transactions.

## Technical Challenges and Solutions

- **Secure Third-Party Authentication:** Implemented secure authentication methods for both delivery companies and electronic payment gateways, ensuring data security and transaction integrity.
  
- **Scalable Backend Development:** Designed and built a robust backend system using Django to accommodate a high user base with fast response times, meeting client performance requirements.

## Lessons Learned

- **Expertise in Third-Party Authentication:** Gained in-depth knowledge of integrating and securing authentication with external services like delivery companies and payment platforms.
  
- **Performance Optimization:** Developed a strong understanding of building scalable Django backends that can handle large user volumes while maintaining responsiveness.
  
- **Teamwork and Problem-Solving:** Honed collaborative skills by working effectively within a team while independently tackling and resolving complex technical challenges.

## Additional Notes

- The platform supports thousands of users with an average response time of under 200ms.
- Utilized specific Django libraries such as Django REST framework, Django Channels for WebSockets, and Celery for asynchronous tasks.
